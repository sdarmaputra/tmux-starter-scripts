# Tmux Starter Script

My personal tmux starter script to bootstrap a working environment based on my daily habit.

## Usage
1. Run the script inside terminal.
2. Wait for tmux to be launched based on the configurations.

## Installation
If you want to run the script directly from the terminal, just place these scripts inside `bin` directory, for example, inside `/usr/local/bin` (I use Ubuntu as an example).

**Note:** for ease of use, you can rename the scripts as you like, for example, rename `tmux-code-warrior` into `tcw` so you can call it by running `tcw` inside the terminal.
